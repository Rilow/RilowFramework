# RilowFramework

This is a simple framework that I created with a bunch of useful utility modules. The modules do
not have to be used together. To use the framework simply copy `framework.py` along with any
modules that you wish to use in your project. e.g. If you only wanted to use the typed module
then you would copy `framework.py` and `typed.py` into your project.
